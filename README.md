## Project Overview

Statistics Peek is a Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site for hosting small statistical reports in Spanish. It uses the Minima theme with custom CSS for enhanced table presentation.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Local development server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Build site (for preview without server)
bundle exec jekyll build
```

No build step is required for deployment - pushing to main branch triggers automatic GitHub Pages builds.

```
